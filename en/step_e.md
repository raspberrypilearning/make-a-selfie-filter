## Add nose, mouth, ears, etc

You can make more accessories by duplicating your sprite, then changing the dropdown on the `go to [ v]` Face Sensing{:class="block3extensions"} block.

--- task ---

Duplicate your sprite:

- Right-click the hat sprite in the sprite list
- Click **duplicate**

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Change the face feature it sticks to:

- Click the duplicated sprite
- In the code, change:

go to [top of head v]

to a different option (like `nose`, `between eyes`, `left ear`, or `right ear`).

--- /task ---

Try these fun combos:

- **Nose sticker**
  - go to [nose v]

- **Glasses 👓**
  - go to [between eyes v]

- **Earrings**
  - Make two sprites:
    - left earring: go to [left ear v]
    - right earring: go to [right ear v]

Tip: Adjusting the costume relative to its **costume center** is usually the easiest way to position accessories on your face.
